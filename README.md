# Delay-Drum
Electronic drum with a 'Looper' mode for layering rhythms and a 'Tap' mode for remixing preset beats. The drum integrates a real darbuka drumhead with a piezo to capture the rich acoustic tones of a hand-played drum.
The drum uses a Teensyduino with an audio shield. The repository includes the Arduino code for both Modes.
